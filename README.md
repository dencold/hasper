# hasper

Hasper is a port of [Ghost's](https://ghost.org/) casper theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static-site generator. It hopes to get you from zero to beautiful with minimal effort. Here's what it looks like:

The theme strives for good design, is responsive out of the box, and has great support for images and media. Additional features include [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments, configurable author details, and social network support.

## Installing Hugo

If you don't have Hugo installed, I recommend reading [these instructions](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/) first. Here's a quick summary to get Hugo working on your system:

0. Go to Hugo's [release page](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases) and grab the tar file that matches your OS and architecture. For example, if you are on a Mac, you'd want `hugo_0.16_osx-64bit.tgz`.
0. Unzip the tar file and copy the hugo binary into your path:

```bash
$ mkdir hugo_0.16; tar xzvf hugo_0.16_osx-64bit.tgz -C hugo_0.16
$ cp hugo_0.16/hugo ~/bin
```

Now you should have Hugo installed and see its version:

```bash
$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.16 BuildDate: 2016-06-06T05:37:59-07:00
```

## Creating a new site

Hugo has a helper command to scaffold a new site together. It creates the initial directory structure and files you need to start writing content. Let's do this for the example site I am working on, bayactive.org:

```bash
$ hugo new site bayactive -f yaml
```

When you run `ls` on the site's directory you should see output like the following:

```bash
$ ls -1 bayactive
archetypes
config.yaml
content
data
layouts
static
themes
```

That's all the organization you'll need to get your site going.

## Installing the theme

Hugo is installed and the scaffolding for your site is in place, let's start using the hasper theme! All you'll need to do is add the hasper repository into your theme directory as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) and you're done! We're using the example site, bayactive, to make it easy to follow along. Feel free to substitute your own site in the examples below if you wish.

```bash
$ cd bayactive
$ git submodule add git@github.com:dencold/hasper.git themes/hasper
```

At this point, you could spin up Hugo's server and take a look at the site on your browser. But, you don't have any content to view, let's fix that...

## Creating your first post

We'll use another Hugo helper command to create a file that represents a new post on your site:

```bash
$ hugo new post/welcome.md -f yaml
```

That command creates a new file located at `content/post/welcome.md`. Also, a quick note on the `-f yaml` option I have been using. Hugo defaults to [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) for metadata, which I'm not a fan of. I prefer to use [yaml](http://yaml.org) as my format for these settings.

Open the `welcome.md` file in your favorite editor and you should see this:

```yaml
---
date: 2016-06-27T17:09:17-07:00
draft: true
title: welcome
---

```

Let's add an actual welcome message here & make sure people know what the site is all about:

```yaml
---
date: 2016-06-27T17:09:17-07:00
draft: true
title: welcome
---

Thanks for visiting BayActive! We hope to be a helpful resource for finding hiking/biking/running routes in the bay area.
```

Save that file, and spin up hugo's internal webserver, using the hasper theme:

```bash
$ hugo serve -D --theme hasper
```

You should see Hugo spit out the following logs:

```

```

If you point your web browser to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313), you'll see the following view:

![First Look](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dencold/static/master/hasper/bayactive-first-take.png)

Which is...pretty boring. Let's fix that.

## Configuring your site

In the [new site creation](#creating-a-new-site) section, you generated a `config.yaml`. This file handles configuration for all the fun features of the hasper theme. Open it up in your editor of choice and you'll see:

```yaml
---
baseurl: http://replace-this-with-your-hugo-site.com/
languageCode: en-us
title: My New Hugo Site
...
```

This was auto-generated when you ran the `hugo new site` command. It explains why we were seeing the generic text when we served up the site. Let's change this to match what we expect for bayactive.

```yaml
---
baseurl: http://www.bayactive.org
languageCode: en-us
title: BayActive
...
```

So far we've been modifying the root config settings which apply to all Hugo sites. But, there is also the `params` mapping section which lets us do some theme-specific setup. Let's start using this section of the config to add a description, logo, and a nice cover picture. This will help make bayactive look like a real site.

```yaml
---
baseurl: http://www.bayactive.org
languageCode: en-us
title: BayActive
params:
  cover: /img/cover.jpg
  logo: /img/logo.svg
  description: Hikes, bikes & rides in the bay
...
```

Note that the cover & logo assets need to be under the static directory that we created [above](#creating-a-new-site). Your directory structure should look something like this:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── archetypes
├── config.yaml
├── content
│   └── post
│       └── welcome.md
├── data
├── layouts
├── static
│   └── img
│       ├── cover.jpg
│       └── logo.svg
```

## A better looking site

Now that we have a proper cover image and logo in place, the page is starting to feel like a real site. If you make another call to `hugo serve` and refresh your browser state, this is what things should now look like:

![Second Look](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dencold/static/master/hasper/bayactive-second.png)

Much better!! Now, try to switch to your own cover image and logo. Update the `config.yaml` and rename the site/update the description. 

You now have everything you need to start producing your own content. Go back and edit your welcome.md post and make a more personal welcome note.

To create additional posts, use the Hugo command we introduced above:

```bash
$ hugo new post/post-name.md -f yaml
```

Start writing some content and sharing with the world!

## Next steps

If you're comfortable with the basics of hasper, there is a lot more to explore. Your next step is to check out the `config-example.yaml` file. This file is fully documented and tries its best to explain each setting available in Hasper. You can pull any of the settings into your own `config.yaml` file to incorporate on your own site.

## Author configuration

Hasper supports multiple authors out of the box. So far, we haven't set any author details, but a small update to the site's `config.yaml` will change all of that. Here is an example from BayActive's `config.yaml`, which defines two authors, Dennis & Greg:

```yaml
author:
  dennis:
    id: "dennis"                            # author's id/short name
    firstName: "Dennis"                     # author's first name
    lastName: "Coldwell"                    # author's last name
    displayName: "dennis"                   # author's prefered display name
    location: "Berkeley, CA"                # author's whereabouts
    bio: "trying to leave things better than I found them."  # short bio, appears below author details on post
    thumbnail: "/img/avatar.jpg"            # author's avatar
  lemond:                                   # you can configure multiple authors
    id: "lemond"
    firstName: "Greg"
    lastName: "LeMond"
    location: "Lakewood, CA"
    bio: "It never gets easier, you just go faster."
    thumbnail: "/img/lemond.jpg"
```

Now that you have the metadata for your author defined, you can start using it in posts via the author attribute of a post's [front-matter](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/). Here's an example:

```yaml
---
date: 2016-06-27T17:09:17-07:00
draft: true
title: welcome
author: dennis
---

Thanks for visiting BayActive! We hope to be a helpful resource for finding hiking/biking/running routes in the bay area.
```

Here's how that visually changes things:
![Author summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dencold/static/master/hasper/bayactive-author-summary.png)

Even better...look what happens when you go to the full posting:
![Author detail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dencold/static/master/hasper/bayactive-author-detail.png)

We now have a nice section for author details at the bottom which pulls in a lot of the metadata you created earlier in the site's `config.yml`. Looking good!!

## Google analytics configuration

You can add the Google Analytics script to your posts and pages by defining the `googleAnalytics` variable in your config.yaml file:

```yaml
---
baseurl: http://www.bayactive.org
languageCode: en-us
title: BayActive
googleAnalytics: "UA-12345-6"
params:
  cover: /img/cover.jpg
  logo: /img/logo.svg
  description: Hikes, bikes & rides in the bay
...
---
```
